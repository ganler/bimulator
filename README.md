## What's this?

- Billiard Simulator.
- Physical Engine(`Box2D`) to simulate the movement of billiards.
- [**impl.**] Graphics pipeline.
- [**impl.**] Real-time ray tracing. (*Zhengrui Qin* also maintained his `WenTracing` in his [repo](https://github.com/MilesChing/WenTracing))
- [**merge**] merged using pixel shader(implemented via fragments shader). 

> The RT procedure produces a `cv::Mat`, and we used it as a texture. Then we combined their colors as follows.
